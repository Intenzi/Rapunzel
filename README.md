A discord bot I had built for my girlfriend to be notified of hair care days.
Features 36 hour reminders at dedicated timezone and repeat reminders for missing days along with history tracking.

One hybrid(slash + message) command with prefixes: `hair`, `ðŸ§¼`
- `hair shampoo` or `/shampoo`

It shows the days you've taken care of your hair, to stay motivated. 

Tracking button prevents extra clicks / misclicks by preventing additional hair care tracking prior to completion of 10 hours.

I initially went with the name of CareBot but I'm sure she wouldn't like that yeah.
Feel free to fork it for your own/ special one.

Dm me @intenzi on discord for any help with installation!
